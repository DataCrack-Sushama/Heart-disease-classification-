Heart Disease Classification Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a project focused on predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is publicly available and consists of patient health records with multiple attributes.

Project Overview
The goal is to develop and compare the performance of several machine learning models for classifying the presence of heart disease. The following algorithms are implemented:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Dataset
The dataset contains information about patients, such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. These features are used to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between features and the target variable.
Model Training: Implementing and training different models using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Comparing models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of X%.
K-Nearest Neighbors: Achieved an accuracy of Y%.
Support Vector Machine: Achieved an accuracy of Z%.
Naive Bayes: Achieved an accuracy of W%.
Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of V%.
Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of U%.
The models' performance is visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
